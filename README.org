#+TITLE: Linux terminal - Screen brightness changer
#+AUTHOR: 64J0 <https://github.com/64J0>

When working with multiple monitors, it's often hard to keep both brightness
synced, which is annoying and probably bad for the eyes health (need to check
this later).

With this in mind, I decided to start exploring how to control the screen
brightness through terminal on Linux. This repository holds what I found most
effective to my case.

** Script

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :tangle screen-brightness.sh :tangle-mode (identity #o744)
  #!/bin/bash
  set -euo pipefail

  # must be a float within 0.0 - 1.0 range
  BRIGHTNESS_LEVEL="${1:-1.0}"

  function main {
      echo "Using BRIGHTNESS_LEVEL: ${BRIGHTNESS_LEVEL}..."
      
      xrandr --listmonitors |\
          grep -E -o '\s\w+(-1)' |\
          xargs -I '{}' xrandr --output '{}' --brightness "${BRIGHTNESS_LEVEL}"
  }

  main
#+END_SRC
